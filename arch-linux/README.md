# Arch Linux Docker files

These Docker files provides desktop applications for Arch Linux. To run desktop applications you can use
[x11docker (Run GUI applications in Docker)](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker).

More information can be found in my [blog posts about docker](https://sandro-keil.de/blog/tag/docker/).

The Docker files are build with `make`.  See [makefile](makefile) for more information. The Docker images are
also available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/sandrokeil).
